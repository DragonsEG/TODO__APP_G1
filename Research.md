# What is an API?

## Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

An Application Programming Interface (API) acts as a bridge between different software components, enabling them to interact and communicate with each other. APIs are an essential part of modern software development, defining rules and methods for accessing specific services or data from a service, library, or system.

## Versatile utility

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) find common use in programming applications for various purposes:

- **Data Retrieval:** APIs allow applications to retrieve data from remote servers, databases, or online services. This data can range from real-time weather information to user profiles and beyond.
- **Submitting Data:** APIs provide a way for applications to send data to a server, facilitating actions such as form submissions, online payments, or updating stored information.

## Presence everywhere

APIs are available everywhere in different fields, including:

- **Mobile Application Development:** Mobile applications typically use APIs to retrieve data from servers, access device features, and integrate with other applications and services.
- **Desktop Applications:** Even desktop programs make use of APIs, allowing connection to web services, databases, and peripheral devices.
- **Web Development:** APIs are prevalent in web development, enabling seamless interactions between web applications and servers, as well as enhancing third-party integrations.

In today's software development landscape, APIs are not just optional but integral and indispensable components. They enable developers to create innovative solutions by harnessing the capabilities of other software components and services. Application programming interfaces (APIs) open the door to improved efficiency, expanded functionality, and seamless integration between diverse technologies.

# Architectural styles for APIs

When using APIs in your project, you will need to choose the suitable architectural style for your project. In this blog, we study several architectural styles for communication in distributed systems. The styles include:

1. **REST Style (Representational State Transfer)**
2. **RPC Style (Remote Procedure Call)**
3. **SOAP Style**
4. **GraphQL Style**

Let's compare these approaches, showing their advantages, disadvantages, commonalities, and differences.

## REST Style

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for services, defining a set of constraints and agreements. A service that complies with REST constraints is said to be RESTful. REST is designed to make optimal use of an HTTP-based infrastructure, and it has been proven effective on the web. Key features of REST include:

- **Uniform Interface:** The interface is consistent and straightforward.
- **Stateless:** Each request is independent, and the server doesn't store client information.
- **Cacheable:** Responses can be cached, enhancing speed and efficiency.
- **Client-Server:** A clear separation between client and server allows independent development.
- **Layered System:** Multiple layers can handle requests, improving scalability and security.
- **Code on Demand:** Code can be delivered and executed on the client, enhancing functionality.

## RPC Style

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is an architectural style for distributed systems. It has been around since the 1980s. Today, the most widely used RPC styles are JSON-RPC and XML-RPC. Even SOAP can be considered to follow an RPC architectural style. Key features of RPC include:

- **Procedures:** Procedures can run on a remote machine within the distributed system.
- **Simplicity:** Calling a remote procedure should be as simple as calling a local procedure.

## SOAP Style

SOAP follows the RPC style and exposes procedures as central concepts (e.g., getCustomer). It is standardized by the W3C and is the most widely used protocol for web services. SOAP style architectures are in widespread use, typically for company internal use or for services called by trusted partners.

## GraphQL Style

GraphQL is a relatively new approach. It challenges the dominance of REST in modern API design. Some key points about GraphQL include:

- Flexibility: GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching.
- Single Endpoint: There's a single endpoint for all queries and mutations.
- Strongly Typed: GraphQL APIs are strongly typed, providing better validation and tooling.
- Real-time: Supports real-time data with subscriptions.

Choosing the right architectural style for your project depends on your specific requirements and constraints.

# Why is REST API so popular?

## Defining REST and API

Let's establish clear definitions for the terms REST, API, and RESTful:

- **API (Application Programming Interface):** An API is a set of definitions and protocols designed for building and integrating application software. It's the language that allows you to communicate with a computer or system, making requests for information or actions.

- **REST (Representational State Transfer):** REST is an architectural style that provides standards for interactions between computer systems over the web. It simplifies system-to-system communication.

- **RESTful:** When web services adhere to the REST architectural style, they are termed RESTful web services.

A RESTful system consists of two essential components:

1. A client that requests resources.
2. A server that holds and provides those resources.

## Architectural Constraints of RESTful API

RESTful APIs adhere to six architectural constraints:

1. **Uniform Interface:** The interface is consistent and straightforward.
2. **Stateless:** Each request is independent, and the server doesn't store client information.
3. **Cacheable:** Responses can be cached, enhancing speed and efficiency.
4. **Client-Server:** A clear separation between client and server allows independent development.
5. **Layered System:** Multiple layers can be used to handle requests, improving scalability and security.
6. **Code on Demand:** Code can be delivered and executed on the client, enhancing functionality.

## Why REST API is Popular

Now, let's delve into why REST APIs are so popular. Here are the key benefits, along with concise explanations:

- **Easy to Understand and Implement:**
  - REST uses familiar HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
  - It follows a client-server architecture, allowing developers to work independently on both ends.
  - This simplicity makes it easy to grasp and implement in your projects.

- **Scalability:**
  - Stateless nature: The server doesn't store client information, enabling it to handle any client request independently.
  - This statelessness enables the deployment of APIs to multiple servers, accommodating many concurrent requests.

- **Cacheable:**
  - Caching for quicker responses is simplified by REST.
  - GET and POST requests can be easily cached using Cache-Control and Expires headers.

- **Flexibility and Portability:**
  - REST allows for easy updates to database data.
  - It supports different data types (XML, JSON, etc.), catering to diverse client requests.
  - REST simplifies resource management, reducing application complexity.

REST APIs have become an integral part of software development due to their simplicity, scalability, cacheability, and flexibility. They empower developers to build interconnected, feature-rich applications with ease, making them a cornerstone of modern web development.


# Benefits of Using REST APIs

REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs offer several key advantages that make them a popular choice for building web services and applications. Here are some of the main benefits of using REST APIs:

1. **Ease of Use and Understanding:** REST APIs are designed with simplicity in mind. They use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, making it intuitive for developers to interact with them. The use of familiar HTTP verbs for specific actions, like "get" for retrieving data and "delete" for removing resources, enhances clarity and ease of use.

2. **Versatile Data Format:** REST APIs can communicate using various data formats, including JSON and XML. This flexibility allows them to adapt to the specific needs of different applications, regardless of their format, programming language, or architecture. Developers can choose the data format that best suits their requirements.

3. **Resource-Based Structure:** REST APIs are structured around resources, which are identified by individual URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Each resource represents a distinct entity or object in the system. This resource-based approach adds a level of organization and flexibility, making it easier to manage and access data.

4. **Decoupling of Data and Technology:** REST separates the data produced and consumed from the underlying technologies used for production and consumption. This decoupling allows developers to make changes and updates to the technology stack without affecting the core functionality of the API. It promotes system flexibility and resilience.

5. **Performance and Scalability:** REST is known for its performance and scalability. Since it relies on the stateless client-server architecture, each request from a client to a server is independent. The server doesn't store information about the client's state between requests. This statelessness simplifies server management and enables horizontal scaling to handle increased load efficiently.

6. **Simplicity and Modifiability:** REST's simplicity makes it easy to modify and extend APIs as needed. Adding new resources or endpoints to an existing API is straightforward. Developers can make incremental changes without disrupting existing functionality. This modifiability is crucial for evolving applications and services over time.

# 6) Challenges of Using REST APIs

In the world of web development, REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are widely used for building and interacting with web services. While REST APIs offer many advantages, they also present several challenges that developers and testers need to address. Here are some of the most prevalent challenges associated with REST APIs:

## 1. Securing REST API Parameter Combinations

- A significant challenge in REST API testing is the sheer number of parameter combinations that must be covered. API parameters are essential for passing data values through API endpoints via data requests. However, certain combinations of parameters can trigger faulty program states, potentially exposing APIs to external attacks or causing crashes.

- To enhance the security of a REST API, comprehensive testing of all possible parameter combinations is essential. However, as the number of parameters grows, the total combinations increase exponentially. Manual testing of these combinations is time-consuming and challenging. Therefore, automated testing approaches capable of generating test cases for various parameters become invaluable, particularly in large projects with numerous dependencies.

## 2. Validating REST APIs Parameters

- Another significant challenge associated with REST APIs is parameter validation. There is a risk that a buggy application or a malicious attacker might call the API with parameters that do not conform to the expected data types or value ranges. Without careful validation, this can lead to crashes or unexpected program behavior, potentially resulting in security or stability issues.

- Considering the vast number of possible values for most data types, it is impractical to manually test all of them. Even with automated testing tools, covering the sheer volume of combinations can be challenging. [White-box testing solutions](https://www.code-intelligence.com/blog/fuzzing-apis) shine in this regard, as they can intelligently select values known from experience to be problematic, automatically generating inputs to explore critical parameter combinations.

## 3. Maintaining Data Formatting

- Data formatting in API testing refers to the schema that specifies how data is structured and formatted within API requests and responses. This schema must be consistently maintained and updated to accommodate newly added parameters and changes. Automated testing solutions often facilitate schema validation by parsing API documentation and generating test cases based on it.

- In continuous testing scenarios, discrepancies between documentation and actual implementation can occur. Detecting and reconciling these discrepancies is crucial to overcome challenges related to data formatting.

## 4. Securing API Call Sequences

- When interacting with an API, a client application typically sends multiple requests, which must be executed in the correct order. Calling requests in the wrong sequence can lead to errors or unexpected behavior. For example, attempting to delete an object before creating it can result in an error.

- Ensuring the correct sequence of REST API calls is often overlooked but is vital for maintaining the quality and security of REST APIs, especially in multithreaded or concurrent execution scenarios.

## 5. Setting up an Automated REST API Test

- The initial configuration of automated REST API testing can be a labor-intensive process. While it is possible to build a continuous testing cycle with open-source software, this approach can be time-consuming, particularly in large projects. In such cases, considering off-the-shelf testing platforms like [CI Fuzz](https://www.code-intelligence.com/cli-tool) is advisable, as they simplify the setup of automated REST API tests.

- Modern testing platforms typically provide step-by-step instructions, guiding users from local installation to the execution of the first automated API test. With some fine-tuning, these platforms enable continuous testing of REST APIs with each code change or pull request, enhancing overall testing efficiency.

## 6. REST API Error Reporting

- Conventional [black-box testing](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/cyber-security/what-is-penetration-testing/what-is-black-box-testing/#:~:text=Black%20box%20testing%2C%20a%20form,automated%20black%20box%20security%20testing.) tools often struggle to measure test coverage during REST API testing. This limitation reduces the effectiveness of test inputs and the value of test reports. In contrast, white-box testing approaches empower testers to generate inputs that cover substantial portions of the tested software, providing detailed error reports and code-coverage visibility.

# 6) How to Create a Simple REST API with the Django REST Framework

In this article, we'll explore how to create a REST API using the Django REST framework. REST APIs are a crucial part of modern web development, allowing applications to communicate and exchange data seamlessly. The Django REST framework simplifies the process of building powerful and efficient RESTful APIs with Django. Let's dive into the steps to create your first REST API:

## What is Django REST Framework (DRF)?

Django REST Framework (DRF) is a Python-based toolkit designed for creating web and REST APIs within Django applications. It offers a wide range of features that enhance web development with Django, including support for HTTP and application middleware, templates, forms, Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, security, data views, database management, and caching.

DRF is known for its flexibility and efficiency. Major companies like Red Hat, Pinterest, Instagram, and Mozilla use this Django API Framework to power their applications. The framework can be installed with a single command using Python's pip package manager.

## Why Should You Use the Django REST Framework?

The Django REST Framework is an excellent choice for web API development, especially for developers who value simplicity, power, and sophistication. Here are some reasons why you should consider using DRF:

- **Simplicity and Power**: DRF is simple to use but incredibly powerful, making it ideal for developers who need to meet deadlines.

- **Authentication**: It provides various authentication techniques, including OAuth1a and OAuth2 packages, to secure your API and define access credentials.

- **Serialization**: DRF offers serialization functionality that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources, making data retrieval and manipulation easy.

- **Documentation**: The framework is backed by extensive documentation and has a strong community, making it developer-friendly.

- **Customizability**: DRF allows you to use general function-based views when you don't need advanced features, giving you flexibility in your development approach.

## Things to Know Before You Create a REST API in Django

Before building a REST API with Django, there are some essential considerations:

- **Third-Party APIs**: When working with external APIs, remember that you have no control over them. If their structure changes, you may need to modify your code accordingly.

- **Caching**: API request/response cycles can be slow without caching. Implement caching to improve performance.

- **Authentication and Security**: APIs require authentication. Ensure high-security measures are in place to protect sensitive data.

- **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of requests your API can handle per hour to avoid overload.

- **Documentation**: Document your API thoroughly, as it can be challenging to find specific code in the source code.

## Things to Do While Building a REST API with Django REST Framework

Here are some best practices to follow when building a REST API with Django REST Framework:

- **Handle Trailing Slashes**: Handle URLs consistently, whether they end with a trailing slash or not.

- **Use Plural Resource Nouns**: Use plural nouns for resource endpoints without including verbs.

- **Understand Status Codes**: Differentiate between HTTP status codes like 403 Forbidden and 401 Unauthorized.

- **Error Handling**: Include detailed error information in the response body for easy debugging.

- **Utilize 202 Accepted**: Use HTTP status code 202 for asynchronous processing and accepted requests.

- **Query String for Filtering**: Use query strings for pagination and filtering.

- **Avoid Nesting Resources**: Keep your resource endpoints flat and avoid deep nesting.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step process of creating a REST API using Django REST Framework.

### 1. Prerequisites
# Before you start

Before you start, make sure you have Python installed. You can check your Python version using the `python --version` command. If Python is not installed, download and install the latest version from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/).

Also, ensure that Django is installed by running the `django-admin --version` command. If it's not installed, you can begin the installation process for Django.

# 2. Install Django REST Framework

The first real step is the Django REST Framework setup.

To isolate dependencies, it would be great if you could build a virtual environment. But you can skip this step as well. From inside your projects folder, you can execute the below-mentioned command to create the virtual environment:

```
python -m venv django env
```
Then, to activate it, run:
```
source./django env/bin/activate
```
Do not forget that each time you open a new terminal session, you must restart your virtual environment. The environment’s name will start to appear in the shell prompt after it is enabled.

It’s time to use the following commands in your terminal to navigate to an empty folder and install Django REST framework:
```
pip install django_rest_framework
```
### 3. Creating a Django App

The steps outlined here will show you how to build a health raking application that gathers and analyzes the health data of patients. Users can interact with the data by sending requests to the API, which will retrieve them from a database.

You don’t need to install an additional database because Django apps come with an SQLite database.

So, in order to create a Django app, we have to create a Django project first. Let’s call it `app`. Run this command:
```
django-admin startproject app
```
We are now creating the Django app calle `healthapp`.
```
django-admi startapp healthapp
```
### 4. Registering the Settings of the App Project and APP URLs

In the `INSTALLED_APPS` file, you need to register the `healthapp` as well as the Django REST Framework in the project settings. This is an important step as Django won’t recognize your app without registration.


Now, as shown below, you have to register the app URLs of `healthapp` in the `urls.py` file:

```python

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [   path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
                   path('', include(healthapp.urls')),   ]

```
### 5. Creating a REST API View

In order to prevent errors, add a dummy view to the `views.py` file of the app. From the Django REST framework, you first have to import the `@apiview` decorator and `Response` object.

This is because `@apiview` displays the API while `Response` returns sterilized data in JSON format.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render  
 from rest_framework.response import Response  
 from rest_framework.decorators import api_view

# Create your views here. 
  @api_view(['GET'])   
def getData(request):  
 return Response()

```
### 6. Building a URL Path for the App

Now for the Django REST Framework API view, you need to build a URL path. Here’s the endpoint representing the `newapp` data.

```python
from django.urls import path   from . import views   from django.conf import settings

urlpatterns = [   path('', views.getData),   path('post/', views.postData),   ]

```
### 7. Creating a Model for the App

The name of the model class of our app is `Data` and this is how it should look:

```python
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class Data(models.Model):
  user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True , blank=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200 )
    description =  models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
    created =  models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    complete =  models.BooleanField(default=False) 

```
Now in the `admin.py` file, you need to register the model. Here’s how:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
 from .models import Data

# Register your models here.
  admin.site.register(Data)

```
### 8. Migrating the App

At this stage, we have to create tables in the SQLite database by making migrations. Run the command:


Now run another command to implement those migrations:

If you are successful at migrating the app, the data will create tables for the  like `healthapp app`. And it should look like this:

![https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/1_6386292ed6.jpg](https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/1_6386292ed6.jpg)

### 9. Adding Data to the Database

Data entry into the database should be done using the Django admin GUI. To view and manage the data in your application, Django admin features a powerful interface.

And if you want to manually enter data into the database, you can utilize the Python shell on the command line.

To create our REST API, we are going to set up and use the Django admin interface. Run:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You then have to enter your email address, username, and password once prompted. And here’s the link to open the admin page after that:

[http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)

This is how the login page looks:

![https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/2_b0c288a07a.jpg](https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/2_b0c288a07a.jpg)

Login Page

After logging in, there you will see Groups and Users model in the Django administration interface. Those are for authentication, and you will find the Data model right below them.

![https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/3_eeef110355.jpg](https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/3_eeef110355.jpg)

Django Administration Data Model

From the admin page, we can delete or add types of data, such as blood sugar level, heart rate, blood pressure, etc., from the database.

Finally, it’s time to create a REST API.

### 10. Serializing the Model

To enable APIs to read data more easily, `serializers` transform complex Django models into JSON objects.


The `ModelSerializer` class is the base class for the `DataSerializer` class, which you create after importing the serializers module from the `rest_framework` package.

After that, define the fields you need to integrate into the API and the Data model to serialize.

### 11. Updating the View

Using the `serializers` and Data models, we now have to update the API view.

Specify a GET method first, using `Data.Objects.all()` to retrieve all the data from the database. After serializing the data, return it as a JSON-formatted response.



[https://127.0.0.1:8000/](https://127.0.0.1:8000/) - navigate to this link and you will see that the API is displaying the data from the database:

![https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/4_08d53846af.jpg](https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/4_08d53846af.jpg)

API Display in Data

Well, you just created a REST API!

### 12. Adding Data with POST

Now you need to check if you can add data to the database using the REST API.



After that, navigate to [https://127.0.0.1:8000/post](https://127.0.0.1:8000/post) and you will see the POST endpoint. In the Content section, add JSON format data to the database and click on the POST option.
The data then will be shown in red in JSON format:

![https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/5_4a567f6aa8.jpg](https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/5_4a567f6aa8.jpg)

Data in JSON Format

After you are done, use [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to navigate back to the GET endpoint. It will show the component as well as the factor.

![https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/4_3b260c8d46.jpg](https://d2ms8rpfqc4h24.cloudfront.net/4_3b260c8d46.jpg)
